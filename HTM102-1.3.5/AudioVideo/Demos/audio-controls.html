    <p>The Outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:<br>
    The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play.<br>
    And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,<br>
    A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.</p>
    
    <p>A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest<br>
    Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;<br>
    They thought, if only Casey could get but a whack at that -<br>
    We'd put up even money, now, with Casey at the bat.</p>
    
    <p>But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,<br>
    And the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake;<br>
    So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,<br>
    For there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat.</p>
    
    <p>But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,<br>
    And Blake, the much despis-ed, tore the cover off the ball;<br>
    And when the dust had lifted, and the men saw what had occurred,<br>
    There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.</p>
    
    <p>Then from 5,000 throats and more there rose a lusty yell;<br>
    It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;<br>
    It knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,<br>
    For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.</p>
    
    <p>There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;<br>
    There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile on Casey's face.<br>
    And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,<br>
    No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.</p>
    
    <p>Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;<br>
    Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt.<br>
    Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,<br>
    Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.</p>
    
    <p>And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br>
    And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.<br>
    Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped-<br>
    "That ain't my style," said Casey. "Strike one," the umpire said.</p>
    
    <p>From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,<br>
    Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore.<br>
    "Kill him! Kill the umpire!" shouted someone on the stand;<br>
    And its likely they'd a-killed him had not Casey raised his hand.</p>
    
    <p>With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;<br>
    He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;<br>
    He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;<br>
    But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, "Strike two."</p>
    
    <p>"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered fraud;<br>
    But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.<br>
    They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,<br>
    And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.</p>
    
    <p>The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;<br>
    He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.<br>
    And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,<br>
    And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.</p>
    
    <p>Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;<br>
    The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,<br>
    And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;<br>
    But there is no joy in Mudville - mighty Casey has struck out.</p>
